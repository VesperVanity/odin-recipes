        <h2>Easy, delicious appetizer using spicy, capicola ham.</h2>
        <p>Make sure you use fresh basil, as the flavors will not be the same if you use dried.</p>
        <p>These can be made ahead of time and refrigerated, but be sure to bring them up to room temperature before serving to blend the flavors.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>

        <h3>Directions: </h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Place a single basil leaf on top of the cream cheese and press down slightly so basil adheres to cheese. Top with a thin slice of capicola.</li>
